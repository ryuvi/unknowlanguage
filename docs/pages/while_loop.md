### The `while` Statement

The `while` statement in this language provides a mechanism to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition evaluates to `true`. It is particularly useful for implementing loops with dynamic conditions, where the number of iterations is not predetermined.

#### Syntax:
```
( WHILE condition statements )
```

- **`condition`**: A logical expression that is evaluated before each iteration. The loop continues as long as this expression evaluates to `true`.
- **`statements`**: A block of code to execute repeatedly as long as the condition holds true.

#### Execution Flow:
1. The `condition` is evaluated at the start of each iteration.
2. If the condition evaluates to `true`:
   - The statements within the loop are executed sequentially.
   - After all statements are executed, the condition is re-evaluated.
3. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates, and execution resumes with the next statement after the `while` block.

#### Example:
```
( WHILE ( <= x 10 )
    ( SHOW x )
    ( ASSIGN ( + x 1 ) x )
)
```

#### Explanation:
1. The loop starts with an initial value of `x` (assumed to be defined in the environment).
2. The condition `( <= x 10 )` checks if `x` is less than or equal to `10`.
3. If true, the loop executes:
   - `( SHOW x )`: Displays the current value of `x`.
   - `( ASSIGN ( + x 1 ) x )`: Increments `x` by 1.
4. The loop continues until `x > 10`.

#### Key Features:
- Supports nested loops by including other `while` or control flow statements in the block.
- Dynamically evaluates the condition during each iteration, allowing complex logic.
- Ensures code modularity by working seamlessly with functions, variables, and other constructs in the language.

This construct offers flexibility and power, making it a fundamental tool for iterative logic in the language.
