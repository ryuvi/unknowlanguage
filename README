# Programming Language Name

Welcome to the development repository of the programming language **[Your Language Name]**! This is an experimental project focused on creating a simple programming language using Python.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a basic programming language that allows variable definition, simple arithmetic operations, and printing values to the screen. The syntax is designed to be simple and similar to other scripting or functional languages.

## Features

Currently, the language supports the following features:

- **Variable definition** using the `assign` command.
- **Display values** using the `show` command.
- **Basic arithmetic operations** like addition.
- **Basic code structures** using parentheses to define blocks.

## Example Code

Here is an example code in the language:

```text
(begin
  (assign 1+1 sum)
  (show sum)
end)
```

In this example:
- The command `assign 1+1 sum` creates the variable `sum` and stores the result of `1 + 1` in it.
- The command `show sum` prints the value of `sum` (which would be `2`).

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites

Before using the language, ensure that **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.

### 2. Installing the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryuvi/unknowlanguage.git
cd unknowlanguage
```

### 3. Running the Code

To test the language, run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Running Tests

The project includes basic tests to verify that the lexer, parser, and executor are working correctly.

```bash
# To run the tests
pytest
```
